How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A simple but stylish website for a local barbershop. They didn't have a big menu of services but wanted their "vibe" to show through.

Optimizations
Added a simple contact form hosted by Netlify. The shop was able to use it easily for new customers

Lessons Learned:
Responsiveness and getting consistent design themes regardless of how the site is viewed.
